# Example Voting App


## Run the app in Kubernetes


Run the following command to create the deployments and services. Note it will create these resources in your current namespace (`default` if you haven't changed it.)

```shell
kubectl create -f .
```

The `vote` web app is then available on port 31000 on each host of the cluster, the `result` web app is available on port 31001.

To remove them, run:

```shell
kubectl delete -f .
```

Also there is an ingress class with the url vote.info and result.info

In order to work you need to modif the /etc/hosts to add the previus URLS  and resolve the DNS
